# Althea Signals Network LLC Website

This is a static website for Althea Signals Network LLC, built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main homepage containing all sections (Hero, About, Services, Contact).
- `styles.css`: The stylesheet containing all visual styles, variables, and responsive design rules.
- `script.js`: Simple JavaScript for mobile menu toggling and smooth scrolling.

## How to Run

1.  **Locally**: Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your web browser.
2.  **GitHub Pages**:
    -   Push this repository to GitHub.
    -   Go to Settings > Pages.
    -   Select the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
    -   Save. Your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## Customization

-   **Colors**: Edit the `:root` variables in `styles.css` to change the color scheme.
-   **Content**: Edit the text directly in `index.html`.
-   **Icons**: The icons are inline SVGs in `index.html`. You can replace them with any SVG icons (e.g., from Heroicons).

## Assets

-   Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts (Inter).
-   No external images are currently used; the design relies on CSS and SVGs.
